# Payload Control Board

During the 2023-2024 design cycle I was tasked with updating the Control Board for the Scientific Payload for Queen's Space Engineering Team.

I worked on 2 revisions of the board being Rev2 and Rev3 with Rev3 being the board used at competition.

## Revision 2
Revision 2 was done in a hurry as we needed a working control board for our systems acceptance review in late Feburary 2024, meaning I needed to order the board early December 2023 before exams started. The hurry comes from the fact that I took over this project from scratch in late November 2023.

### Scope and Functional Requirements
The scope and requirements of this control board came from the requirements from the Science and Mechanical team along with the 2024 University Rover Challenge (URC) Science mission rules. The scope and requirements were as follows:
- Control 2 Stepper Motors to raise and lower the payload
- Control up to 6 Servos for collection scoops and an auger
- Be able to toggle and change the brightness of 9 incandescent lights for the on-board spectrometer.
- Interface with the Rover through serial communication
- Interface with Sensors to get scientific measurements
